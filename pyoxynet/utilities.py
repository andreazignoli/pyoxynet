def PrintHello():
    """This function does something.

    Args:
       name (str):  The name to use.

    Kwargs:
       state (bool): Current state to be in.

    Returns:
       int.  The return code::

          0 -- Success!
          1 -- No good.
          2 -- Try again.

    Raises:
       AttributeError, KeyError

    A really great idea.  A way you might use me is

    >>> print public_fn_with_googley_docstring(name='foo', state=None)
    0

    BTW, this always returns 0.  **NEVER** use with :class:`MyPublicClass`.
