## The Roadmap: 8 Phases to Market Readiness

### Phase 1: Foundation & Security 🛡️ (Weeks 1-2)
*"Make it safe to work with"*

#### 1.1 Immediate Security Fixes
**Why**: Address critical vulnerabilities that make the application unsafe for production use.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Replace hardcoded secret key with environment variables
- [ ] Implement input validation using Pydantic or Marshmallow
- [ ] Add file upload validation (type, size, content checking)
- [ ] Remove debug mode and add proper environment configuration
- [ ] Implement basic CORS configuration

**Code Example**:
```python
# Before (DANGEROUS)
app.secret_key = "super secret key"
data = request.get_json(force=True)

# After (SECURE)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
data = validate_cpet_data(request.get_json())
```

#### 1.2 Basic Testing Infrastructure
**Why**: Establish foundation for confident code changes and prevent regressions.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up pytest configuration and structure
- [ ] Create basic unit tests for core CPET processing functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for main API endpoints
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting

**Structure**:
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_cpet_processing.py
│   ├── test_validation.py
│   └── test_models.py
├── integration/
│   ├── test_api_endpoints.py
│   └── test_file_processing.py
└── fixtures/
    └── sample_cpet_data/
```

#### 1.3 Logging Infrastructure
**Why**: Essential for debugging, monitoring, and understanding production issues.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement structured logging with Python's logging module
- [ ] Add request/response logging middleware
- [ ] Configure different log levels for different environments
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (initially simple file-based)

### Phase 2: Architectural Refactoring 🏗️ (Weeks 3-5)
*"Break the monolith, build it right"*

#### 2.1 Modular Architecture Design
**Why**: Current 27K+ token monolithic file is unmaintainable and untestable.

**New Structure**:
```
pyoxynet_api/
├── api/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── cpet_analysis.py
│   │   ├── file_upload.py
│   │   └── health.py
│   └── middleware/
├── core/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── cpet_processor.py
│   │   ├── file_validator.py
│   │   └── ml_inference.py
│   └── utils/
├── config/
│   ├── development.py
│   ├── production.py
│   └── testing.py
└── schemas/
    ├── requests.py
    └── responses.py
```

#### 2.2 Service Layer Implementation
**Why**: Separate business logic from API layer for better testing and reusability.

**Services to Create**:
- `CPETProcessorService`: Core CPET data analysis
- `FileValidationService`: File upload and validation
- `MLInferenceService`: TensorFlow Lite model execution  
- `ReportGenerationService`: Output formatting and export

#### 2.3 Database Layer (Future-Proofing)
**Why**: Even without user accounts, structured data storage improves performance and enables features.

**Initial Implementation**:
- SQLite for development
- PostgreSQL ready for production
- Models for: ProcessingJobs, ProcessingResults, APIUsage
- Alembic migrations for schema management

### Phase 3: Modern API Design 🌐 (Weeks 6-7)
*"Build the API developers will love"*

#### 3.1 RESTful API Redesign
**Why**: Consistent, predictable APIs are easier to integrate and maintain.

**New Endpoint Structure**:
```
POST   /api/v1/cpet/analyze          # Single file analysis
POST   /api/v1/cpet/batch-analyze    # Multiple file analysis
GET    /api/v1/cpet/jobs/{job_id}    # Job status
GET    /api/v1/cpet/results/{job_id} # Results download
GET    /api/v1/health                # Health check
POST   /api/v1/auth/token            # Authentication
```

#### 3.2 Request/Response Standardization
**Why**: Consistent data formats reduce integration complexity for users.

**Standard Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "job_id": "uuid-here",
    "status": "completed",
    "results": {...}
  },
  "metadata": {
    "processing_time": 2.34,
    "api_version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

#### 3.3 OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation
**Why**: Self-documenting APIs accelerate user adoption and reduce support burden.

**Implementation**:
- Use Flask-RESTX or similar for automatic OpenAPI generation
- Interactive documentation at `/docs`
- Code examples in multiple languages
- Authentication flow documentation

### Phase 4: Authentication & Rate Limiting 🔐 (Week 8)
*"Control access, prevent abuse"*

#### 4.1 JWT Authentication
**Why**: Stateless authentication scales better than sessions and enables API key management.

**Implementation**:
- JWT token generation and validation
- API key alternative for programmatic access
- Token refresh mechanism
- Rate limiting per user/API key

**Flow**:
```python
# User registration (simple, no database initially)
POST /api/v1/auth/register
{
  "email": "researcher@university.edu",
  "organization": "University Lab"
}

# Response includes API key
{
  "api_key": "px_live_1234567890abcdef",
  "expires_in": "never"  # Initially permanent keys
}
```

#### 4.2 Rate Limiting
**Why**: Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across all users.

**Strategy**:
- 100 requests/hour for free tier (initial)
- Different limits for different endpoints
- Redis-based counting (or in-memory for start)
