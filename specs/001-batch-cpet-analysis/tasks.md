# Tasks: Batch CPET Analysis

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-batch-cpet-analysis/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create backend and frontend project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize Python backend with Flask, pandas, pyoxynet dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure pytest and code formatting tools
- [ ] T004 [P] Setup frontend structure with basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T005 [P] Contract test POST /batch/upload in backend/tests/contract/test_batch_upload.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Contract test GET /batch/{id}/status in backend/tests/contract/test_batch_status.py
- [ ] T007 [P] Contract test GET /batch/{id}/results in backend/tests/contract/test_batch_results.py
- [ ] T008 [P] Integration test file upload workflow in backend/tests/integration/test_upload_workflow.py
- [ ] T009 [P] Integration test batch processing in backend/tests/integration/test_batch_processing.py

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T010 [P] BatchJob model in backend/src/models/batch_job.py
- [ ] T011 [P] CPETFile model in backend/src/models/cpet_file.py
- [ ] T012 [P] FileValidationService in backend/src/services/file_validation.py
- [ ] T013 [P] BatchProcessingService in backend/src/services/batch_processing.py
- [ ] T014 POST /batch/upload endpoint in backend/src/api/batch_routes.py
- [ ] T015 GET /batch/{id}/status endpoint in backend/src/api/batch_routes.py
- [ ] T016 GET /batch/{id}/results endpoint in backend/src/api/batch_routes.py
- [ ] T017 File upload validation and error handling in backend/src/api/batch_routes.py
- [ ] T018 Background task processing with pyoxynet models in backend/src/services/batch_processing.py
- [ ] T019 [P] Security validation service in backend/src/services/security_service.py
- [ ] T020 [P] File cleanup service in backend/src/services/cleanup_service.py

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T021 Connect BatchProcessingService to SQLite database
- [ ] T022 Integrate security validation into upload pipeline
- [ ] T023 Progress tracking and logging system
- [ ] T024 Error handling and user feedback system

## Phase 3.5: Frontend Implementation
- [ ] T025 [P] File upload component in frontend/src/components/upload.js
- [ ] T026 [P] Progress tracking component in frontend/src/components/progress.js
- [ ] T027 [P] Results display component in frontend/src/components/results.js
- [ ] T028 Main application page in frontend/src/pages/batch-analysis.html
- [ ] T029 CSS styling for user interface in frontend/src/styles/main.css

## Phase 3.6: Polish
- [ ] T030 [P] Unit tests for validation logic in backend/tests/unit/test_file_validation.py
- [ ] T031 [P] Unit tests for batch processing in backend/tests/unit/test_batch_service.py
- [ ] T032 [P] Unit tests for security services in backend/tests/unit/test_security_service.py
- [ ] T033 Performance tests for 100+ file processing within 5-minute target
- [ ] T034 [P] API documentation in docs/api.md
- [ ] T035 Memory optimization to stay under 2GB per batch limit
- [ ] T036 Integration testing with real CPET data files

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T004) before tests (T005-T009)
- Tests (T005-T009) before implementation (T010-T018)
- Models (T010-T011) before services (T012-T013)
- Services before API endpoints (T014-T016)
- Backend completion before frontend (T023-T027)
- Implementation before polish (T028-T033)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T005-T009 together:
Task: "Contract test POST /batch/upload in backend/tests/contract/test_batch_upload.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /batch/{id}/status in backend/tests/contract/test_batch_status.py"  
Task: "Contract test GET /batch/{id}/results in backend/tests/contract/test_batch_results.py"
Task: "Integration test file upload workflow in backend/tests/integration/test_upload_workflow.py"
Task: "Integration test batch processing in backend/tests/integration/test_batch_processing.py"
```

## Task Generation Rules
1. **From Contracts**: Each API endpoint has contract test and implementation
2. **From Data Model**: BatchJob and CPETFile entities have model tasks
3. **From User Stories**: File upload and batch processing have integration tests
4. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Models → Services → API → Frontend → Polish

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model tasks  
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
