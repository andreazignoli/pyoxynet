# Feature Specification: Batch CPET Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `001-batch-cpet-analysis`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Batch CPET Analysis Feature for processing multiple cardiopulmonary exercise test files"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a researcher, I want to process multiple CPET files at once so that I can analyze large datasets efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** multiple CPET CSV files in a directory, **When** I run batch analysis, **Then** all files are processed and results are generated
2. **Given** a mix of valid and invalid CPET files, **When** I run batch analysis, **Then** valid files are processed and errors are logged for invalid ones

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the directory is empty?
- How does system handle corrupted CSV files?
- What if some files are missing required columns?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload multiple CPET files
- **FR-002**: System MUST process up to 100 CPET files within 5 minutes  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to upload files via web interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate CPET data format
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate comprehensive reports containing domain probability classifications, exercise efficiency metrics, and processing error summaries
- **FR-006**: System MUST support processing up to 1000 files per batch with memory usage under 2GB
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide secure file handling including file type validation, virus scanning, automatic cleanup after processing, and no persistent storage of medical data
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate summary statistics for each file
- **FR-010**: System MUST export results in CSV, JSON, and PDF formats
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to track processing status

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CPET File**: Represents cardiopulmonary exercise test data with VO2, VCO2, VE measurements
- **Batch Job**: Represents a collection of CPET files to be processed together
- **Analysis Result**: Contains processed metrics and domain classifications
- **Report**: Summary of analysis results across multiple files
